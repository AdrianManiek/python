God Words Generator

God Words Generator is a minimal command-line random word generator written in Python.

The script outputs randomly selected words, one at a time, from a predefined list — triggered manually by user input.

The project is inspired by the Random Word Generator demonstrations by Terry A. Davis in TempleOS.
